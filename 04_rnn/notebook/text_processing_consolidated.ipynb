    "#### Few Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Context of the word\n",
    "\n",
    "The context of the word is the key measure of meaning that is utilized in Word2Vec.  The context of the word “sat” in the sentence “the cat sat on the mat” is (“the”, “cat”, “on”, “the”, “mat”).  In other words, it is the words which commonly occur around the target word “sat”. Words which have similar contexts share meaning under Word2Vec, and their reduced vector representations will be similar.  In the skip-gram model version of Word2Vec (more on this later), the goal is to take a target word i.e. “sat” and predict the surrounding context words.  This involves an iterative learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Negative Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with using a full softmax output layer is that it is very computationally expensive. During bacpropagation, large numder of weights that need to be updated in any gradient based training of the output layer.  This gets seriously time-consuming and inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this problem is **negative sampling**, which is described in the original Word2Vec paper by Mikolov et al.  It works by reinforcing the strength of weights which link a target word to its context words, but rather than reducing the value of all those weights which aren’t in the context, it simply samples a small number of them – these are called the “negative samples”.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Creating the train data\n",
    "\n",
    "To train our data set using negative sampling and the skip-gram method, we need to create data samples for both valid context words and for negative samples. This involves scanning through the data set and picking target words, then randomly selecting context words from within the window of words around the target word (i.e. if the target word is “on” from “the cat sat on the mat”, with a window size of 2 the words “cat”, “sat”, “the”, “mat” could all be randomly selected as valid context words).  It also involves randomly selecting negative samples outside of the selected target word context. Finally, we also need to set a label of 1 or 0, depending on whether the supplied context word is a true context word or a negative sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Keras skipgrams function does exactly what we want of it – it returns the word couples in the form of (target, context) and also gives a matching label of 1 or 0 depending on whether context is a true context word or a negative sample. By default, it returns randomly shuffled couples and labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "    * couples - list of tuples in the form of (target word, context of word)\n",
    "    * labels - label indicating whether the corresponding couple has true context word or a negative sample"

    "#### Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the embedding layer using negative samples, we can construct our network in a way that the output layer is a multi-class softmax layer, we can change it into a simple binary classifier.  For words that are in the context of the target word, we want our network to output a 1, and for our negative samples, we want our network to output a 0. Therefore, the output layer of our Word2Vec Keras network is simply a single node with a sigmoid activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need a way of ensuring that, as the network trains, words which are similar end up having similar embedding vectors.  Therefore, we want to ensure that the trained network will always output a 1 when it is supplied words which are in the same context, but 0 when it is supplied words which are never in the same context. Therefore, we need a vector similarity score supplied to the output sigmoid layer – with similar vectors outputting a high score and un-similar vectors outputting a low score.  The most typical similarity measure used between two vectors is the cosine similarity score:\n",
    "\n",
    "So with all in perspective, our model contains the following layers\n",
    "\n",
    "* An (integer) input of a target word and a real or negative context word\n",
    "* An embedding layer lookup (i.e. looking up the integer index of the word in the embedding matrix to get the word vector)\n",
    "* The application of a dot product operation\n",
    "* The output sigmoid layer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s go through this architecture more carefully.  First, each of the words in our vocabulary is assigned an integer index between 0 and the size of our vocabulary (in this case, 10,000).  We pass two words into the network, one the target word and the other either a word from the surrounding context or a negative sample.  We “look up” these indexes as the rows of our embedding layer (10,000 x 128 weight tensor) to retrieve our 128 length word vectors.  We then perform a dot product operation between these vectors to get the similarity.  Finally, we output the similarity to a sigmoid layer to give us a 1 or 0 indicator which we can match with the label given to the Context word (1 for a true context word, 0 for a negative sample).\n",
    "\n",
    "The back-propagation of our errors will work to update the embedding layer to ensure that words which are truly similar to each other (i.e. share contexts) have vectors such that they return high similarity scores."
